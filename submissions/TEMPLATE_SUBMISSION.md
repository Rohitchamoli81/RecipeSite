## Project Title
RecipeSite

## Project Description    
Recipe Hub is a full-featured recipe website built using React and Appwrite as the backend service. It allows users to explore recipes fetched from an external API, manage personal blogs, and interact with various categories and detailed recipe pages â€” all with smooth routing and global state management.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
The concept of the project was inspired by the fact that many recipe sites are mainly dedicated to video tutorials and these may take up too much time when the user already has the knowledge of how he can cook. I wanted to create something different - a recipe site in which a user can easily see ingredients and ways of cooking without watching video.

This makes the site easier to the individuals who have the habit of reading and cooking on written recipes without having to watch the procedures.

To make the platform more interacting I added a blog area where people can write about their own food experiences, tips, or recipes to make the platform more of a small community around cooking.

Technically, I decided to use Appwrite to learn about a current Backend-as-a-Service platform, which supports authentication, database, storage, and serverless functions in a unified way. The experience of this project brought me to grasp the concept of full-stack integration, API management, state management through Redux, and client-side routing via React Router all the while creating something that is useful and easy to use.

## Tech Stack    
This project was created by using the React (with Vite) framework to ensure a rapid, optimized experience to develop a frontend and using Appwrite as the backend service.

React (Vite): React is a framework applied in the development of the user interface, component management, and the optimization of performance based on the fast build system of Vite.

Redux: It has been introduced to manage state globally to allow the management of recipe data, user authentication state, and blog information to flow across multiple pages easily.

React Router: React router is utilized to provide the multi-page experience where each page can be easily navigated such as Home, Blog, Category, and Detail of Recipe.

Appwrite: The backend platform to manage backend .
